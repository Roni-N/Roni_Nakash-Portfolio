# Hello and welcome to my portfolio!
------------------------------------------------------------

## My name is Roni Nakash, and I'm a Data Scientist.

I have a Master's (MS.c) in Industrial Engineering (specialization in Data Science) 
and a bachelor's (BS.c) in Industrial Engineering (specialization in information systems) 
from Ben Gurion University.


In this portfolio, I will share with you some of my knowledge in the fields of
Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence Statistics, Python and more.

I hope you will find this information helpful, and I would love to hear your opinion :)
Please feel free to contact me in any matter!
Cheers :)

# Classification Project: Insurance claim prediction 

Insurance claim prediction project.
This project is a supervised learning classification task based on structured data.
In this project we will develop an Insurance claim prediction model using different data sources.

In this project, we will use the CRISP-DM methodology and popular data science and machine learning techniques, such as:  
data integration, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, feature selection, imbalance date methods, machine learning models, evaluation and  hyperparameters tuning using: python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), statistics, and more.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
