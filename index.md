## <span style="color:#4863A0">Classification Project:<br> Insurance claim prediction.</span>
------------------------------------------------------------
> **Project purpose:** The purpose of this project is to conduct a supervised learning classification task based on structured data.  <br>

> **Project objective:** The objective of this project is to develop a claim prediction model from different data sets using data science and machine learning  methods (both theoretical and practical).<br> The purpose of this model is to predict (and determine the probability) whether future policyholders will make a future claim based on their characteristics.

> **Motivation:** A claim prediction model could be a valuable and powerful tool for the insurance industry. With this tool, insurance companies can minimize risks, provide customized pricing and premiums, streamline operational processes, drive down costs, and increase profit margins.

### <span style="color:#4863A0">This project is based on the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following steps:</span>
