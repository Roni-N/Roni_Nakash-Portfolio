## <span style="color:#4863A0">Classification Project:<br> Insurance claim prediction.</span>
------------------------------------------------------------
> **Project purpose:** The purpose of this project is to conduct a supervised learning classification task based on structured data.  <br>

> **Project objective:** The objective of this project is to develop a claim prediction model from different data sets using data science and machine learning  methods (both theoretical and practical).<br> The purpose of this model is to predict (and determine the probability) whether future policyholders will make a future claim based on their characteristics.

> **Motivation:** A claim prediction model could be a valuable and powerful tool for the insurance industry. With this tool, insurance companies can minimize risks, provide customized pricing and premiums, streamline operational processes, drive down costs, and increase profit margins.

### <span style="color:#4863A0">This project is based on the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following steps:</span>

#### 3.2 Feature Selection: -- **Will be updated soon!!**
In this part, we will use feature selection methods to reduce the number of input variables (i.e. remove non-informative or redundant features) to those that will provide the greatest level of predictive power for the target variable.<br>
**Topics covered:**
>- **Filter methods** (variance and statistical test, correlations, univariate selection)
>- **Wrapper methods** (forward / backward selection, exhaustive search)
>- **Embedded methods** (lasso, tree importance)

#### 3.3 Imbalance Data: -- **Will be updated soon!!**
This section will conclude with Imbalanced data handling. Our data set does not have an equally distributed distribution of observations by class. Most standard classifier learning algorithms performed poorly in this issue cloud. It can be resolved by balancing the two classes.<br>
**Topics covered:**
>- **Undersampling** (Fixed and Cleaning methods).
>- **Oversampling** ( sample extraction and sample generation methods).
>- **Ensemble Method** (data level, cost-sensitive, ensemble algorithms).
